## Official Coding Period: Week 2 (June 9 - June 15)

At the start of this week, my mentor let me know that I named some of the files wrong and I realised that the process and driver files should not just be centered around my function solely because there would be other ordering functions that will exist alongside sloan, like the experimental cuthillMckee ordering and the king ang mindegree ordering (which are being implemented by my co-mentee Fan Wu). So I had to adjust the naming according to the general convention haha, so silly of me.

This week was focused on refining the initial setup and resolving issues that arose from the first implementation pass. While the original plan was to implement the core algorithm and begin unit testing, the priorities shifted to fixing foundational aspects of the codebase.


I renamed several files to follow proper naming conventions:

  - Renamed `sloanOrdering_process.cpp` to `ordering_process.cpp`
  
  - Renamed `sloanOrdering_driver.cpp` to `ordering_driver.cpp`

Added `include/ordering/sloanOrdering.hpp` to house the core algorithm logic to call the Boost function later on.

Fixed license headers across all new files

Resolved compilation errors

Updated all relevant CMakeLists.txt files to reflect these changes

This cleanup ensures consistency across the project and prepares the codebase for the actual algorithm implementation in the coming weeks.
