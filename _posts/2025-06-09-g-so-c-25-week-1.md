## Official Coding Period: Week 1 (June 2 - June 8)

This week focused on setting up the foundation for pgr_sloanOrdering(). While the original plan was to review the Boost Graph Library and design data structures, I revised the plan to first establish a complete C++ skeleton of the implementation.

I created the initial structure for all necessary files across SQL, header, and source directories, including:

`pgr_sloanOrdering.sql`, `_pgr_sloanOrdering.sql`

Driver and process headers and source files

The C wrapper: `sloanOrdering.c`

I also updated the CMakeLists.txt to integrate the new files into the build system. Additionally, I attended the weekly meeting on June 2, 2025, where we discussed project structure and next steps. By next week, I hope to resolve some or most parts of the compilation errors and identify any setbacks or mistakes in my existing code to refine them better.
