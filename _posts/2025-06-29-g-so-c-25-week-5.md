## Official Coding Period: Week 5 (June 30 - July 6)

This week, I fixed the input parameters in the SQL file to return a set of seq and node for the ordering function. I focused on solving all the compilation and style errors this time. 
One major change I implemented was replace all custom tuple types `II_r_t` with `int64_t` arrays. I removed the minute changes in the documentation references for now since we are not working with them for the time being.
Started with the `docqueries` and added the example and test configuration to the documentation build. Then, I further simplified the result tuple logic and removed unused helper and type includes.

Sequence:

    User->>SQL_Function: CALL pgr_sloanOrdering(edges_sql)
    SQL_Function->>C_Layer: _pgr_sloanordering(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
    C_Layer->>Ordering_Process: pgr_process_ordering(edges_sql, which, int64_t **, size_t *)
    Ordering_Process->>Ordering_Driver: do_ordering(edges_sql, which, int64_t **, size_t *, ...)
    Ordering_Driver-->>Ordering_Process: result_tuples (int64_t array)
    Ordering_Process-->>C_Layer: result_tuples, result_count
    C_Layer-->>SQL_Function: Construct tuples from int64_t array
    SQL_Function-->>User: Return result set
I also changed the type of hint from nullptr to "" in the C file. Other bug fixes include correcting function signature comments to accurately reflect the current parameter list.
